### Goals

- Define the learning mission: build a blog to learn Astro deliberately.
- Establish Git discipline (`main` for prod, `develop` for integration, feature branches in English).
- Integrate Tailwind CSS v4 with Vite plugin support.
- Document how AI will assist (requirements prompts, PR-style reviews).

### Highlights

- Created `BaseLayout` with shared slots (`hero`, `sidebar`) and global styles.
- Added mentor instructions (`AGENT.md`, `SKILL.md`) to keep tone and flow consistent.
- Verified everything with `pnpm build` and updated README with the workflow checklist.
